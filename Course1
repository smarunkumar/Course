Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Arun Kumar SM
EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis
I have learned the basics of data analysis and the flow for Data Analysis goes as follows: 
Data Sourcing, Data Cleaning, Univariate Analysis, Segmented Analysus, Bivariate Analysis and Derived metrics.

Before data analysis starts, we need to clean data and make it compatible to begin the analysis. 
We can get some insights from Univariate/Segmented/Bivariate/Derived metrics and based on the insights we may come up with a conclusion for the problem statement or might have more questions to the problem statement to get better clarity.
